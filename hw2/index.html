				<h2>Your Industrial Operating System</h2>				
				<p>In today’s challenging times, you need to drive more performance from your assets, collaborate better and generate more value from your existing automation systems.</p>
				<p>Being the leader in Human Machine Interface (HMI) and Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) technology, the Wonderware brand represents the next step in industrial software design and management — Wonderware System Platform.</p>
				<p>Wonderware System Platform acts as your “Industrial Operating System” by providing common services such as; visualization, configuration, deployment, communication, security, data connectivity, data storage and management, people collaboration, and many others. These services allow you to build a single, unified “Plant Model” that logically represents your processes, physical equipment and industrial systems, even legacy systems, making the design and maintenance of these systems more efficient, more flexible and with less risk. The Plant Model also gives essential context to your data, greatly assisting with diagnostics and troubleshooting, as well as providing valuable system documentation throughout the system lifecycle. The Plant Model is unique to the Wonderware System Platform.</p>
				<p>The System Platform also provides a high-performance process historian with production history archiving and retrieval, along with an industrial web information server that dramatically simplifies the organization and delivery of operations information to all functions within your organization.</p>
				<p>Whatever you do, Wonderware System Platform helps you do it BETTER, FASTER, SAFER, and CHEAPER.</p>

			<h2>Wonderware system platform frequently asked questions</h2>
			<h3>Compatibility and System Requirements</h3>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>Q: </strong>What are the OS, Software, and Hardware requirements for installing Wonderware products?</dt>
					<dd>
						<p><strong>A: </strong>You select the Operating System based on the requirements defined by the system architecture. The OS requirements for
						Development Node, Application Node, and GR Node are different. Some Operating Systems might be compatible with your Development Node and incompatible with the other nodes (and vice-versa).</p>
						<p>
						Similarly, SQL Server requirements for each product are different. To get a list of compatible OS and SQL Server version, refer to the ReadMe file of the specific Wonderware product you are installing. The document also provides the Minimum Hardware, Software, and Compatibility requirements for successful installation and operation of the system. The ReadMe file is located in the Wonderware installation CD and on the Wonderware Developer Network (WDN).</p>
